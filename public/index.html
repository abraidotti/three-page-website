<!-- Create a web page about you! Imagine you only had 3 pages for your portfolio as a Web Developer.
What would you put on it? How would you display the information?
What would it look like? What do you want the user to see and notice first?

For this assignment, you will design your portfolio page around the 3 device types:
mobile (480px), tablet (768 px) and desktop (992px).
Add your hero image, navigation, and content.
Then you will adjust your browser to the second device size.
Add your CSS breakpoints to this new view. Then adjust your browser to the third size.
Add your CSS breakpoints to this new view and design your content to fit. -->
